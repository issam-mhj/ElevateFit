## About The Project

ElevateFit is a front-end development project focused on creating a responsive and interactive e-commerce website for fitness-related products. The project aims to provide users with a seamless shopping experience, featuring product listings, detailed product views, a shopping cart, and a checkout page. The site incorporates user stories related to product filtering, responsive navigation, and interactive elements to enhance user engagement.

### Key Features

- **Product Listing and Filtering:** Users can view a list of clothing items and filter them by category and price range.
- **Product Details:** Clicking on a product displays detailed information, including price, description, images, and customer reviews.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add items to a cart, view the total price, update quantities, and remove items.
- **Responsive Navbar:** The navigation bar adapts to different screen sizes for easy mobile navigation.
- **Interactive Elements:** "Add to cart" buttons have hover effects, and a price range slider allows users to filter products based on their budget.

## Architecture
The ElevateFit project is structured with the following technologies:

- **HTML:** Provides the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.  The project uses multiple CSS files for different sections, including banner styles, detail page styles, and general styles.
- **JavaScript:** Implements interactive elements and dynamic functionality, such as product filtering and cart management.  jQuery is used in `index.html` and `p.html`.
- **Font Awesome:** Provides icons for various UI elements.
- **Google Fonts (Poppins):** Used for consistent typography across the website.
